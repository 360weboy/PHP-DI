# Migrating from PHP-DI 3.x to 4.0

PHP-DI 4.0 is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will (hopefully) help you migrate from a 3.x version to 4.0.

## Annotations

The `lazy` option has disappeared:

```php
class Example {
    /**
     * @Inject(lazy=true)
     * @var Foo
     */
    private $property;
}
```

Now, you can only define a whole service as lazy, for example with annotations:

```php
/**
 * @Injectable(lazy=true)
 */
class Foo {
}
```

## Definitions

The biggest BC break is between the definitions format. The new definition format is very different from the old one,
because it is based on function helpers, not an array or YAML structure.

To be clear: YAML configuration is not supported anymore.

Here is a comparison:

```php
// Before
return [
    'My\Class' => [
        'constructor' => [
            'host' => 'db.host',
            'port' => 'db.port',
        ],
        'methods' => [
            'setFoo' => [ 'My\Foo' ],
        ],
    ],
];

// After
return [
    'My\Class' => DI\object()
        ->constructor(DI\link('db.host'), DI\link('db.port'))
        ->method('setFoo', DI\link('My\Foo'))
];
```

You may or may not like this choice, but this is the conclusion of a lot of thinking and trials.
If you are interested, you can read more here: [Thoughts about PHP-DI 4.0](https://gist.github.com/mnapoli/6890585),
the main reason is that offering a YAML DSL is very restrictive over what we can do with PHP code,
mainly **closures**.

We actually recommend that any complex definition should be written in PHP code using an anonymous function:

```php
return [
    MyClass::class => DI\factory(function (ContainerInterface $c) {
        $o = new MyClass($c->get('db.host'), $c->get('db.port'));
        $o->setFoo($c->get(Foo::class));
        return $o;
    })
];
```

Using real PHP code is of course better, because it's easier to maintain, it is less tied to PHP-DI and it's
not limited by an API.

On the other hand, the helper functions are helpful if you are writing a simple definition.

## Creating the container

You are encouraged to use the `ContainerBuilder` to create the `Container` if you weren't already doing this.

The API of the `ContainerBuilder` has changed a bit:

- `setDefinitionsValidation` has been removed (since it's PHP code it's validated by PHP)
- `addDefinitionsFromFile` is now `addDefinitions` and now takes a file name (simpler)
