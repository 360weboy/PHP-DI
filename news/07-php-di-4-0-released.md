# PHP-DI 4.0 released

*Posted by [Matthieu Napoli](http://mnapoli.fr) on January 17th 2014*

I am extremely happy to announce that PHP-DI version 4.0 has just been released!

This is a new major release, and it delivers. As indicated by "major release", it comes with BC breaks, but this is for the better.

## Completely new definition format

PHP-DI 3.x offered several definition formats, such as:

- autowiring (use of reflection)
- annotations
- YAML
- PHP array
- various undocumented, unstable formats (XML, JSON)â€¦

PHP-DI 4.0 now offers:

- autowiring (unchanged)
- annotations (very few changes)
- PHP definitions

The last one is completely new, and is the result of several months of brainstorming and trials.
